I will eventually add a description, documentation and a help section to this readme.md file. But ill get to that at some other point in time. For now, all you need to know is this is a project developed by a 16 year old computer science student in my spare time. This project is currently unfinished as it only includes a video downloader. Eventually i plan for this program to have alot of small features you may google every now and then (video downloader, file converter, calculator, autoclicker, automatic downloads, etc). This project will probally be my biggest coding project to date.
