I will eventually add a description, documentation and a help section to this readme.md file. But ill get to that at some other point in time. For now, all you need to know is this is a project developed by a 16 year old computer science student in my spare time. This project is currently unfinished as it only includes a video downloader. Eventually i plan for this program to have alot of small features you may google every now and then (video downloader, file converter, calculator, autoclicker, automatic downloads, etc). This project will probally be my biggest coding project to date.

### DESCRIPTION ###
Vault will be an open source bit-of-everything program that can do, you guessed it, a bit of everything. It will (hopefully) contain the following features (at v1.0.0):
- Video Downloader (done)
- File Converter
- Calculator
- Autoclicker
- Automated Downloads
- File Archiver (maybe)

Eventually, i will make an installer that you can choose which features you want to download and which you dont want to. Say if you want to have the video downloader and the file converter, but dont want the calculator or file archiver, you can enable or disable those specific features in the installation wizard.
